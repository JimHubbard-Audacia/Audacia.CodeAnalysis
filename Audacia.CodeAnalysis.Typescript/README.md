# Audacia.CodeAnalysis.Typescript

### ESLint ruleset for Javascript and Typescript projects

## Getting started

First, we need to install the package from the private npm feed:
`npm install @audacia/eslint-config`

Now, a simple `.eslintrc.js` file needs to be placed in the project root. You can copy and paste the one found [here](https://dev.azure.com/audacia/Audacia/_git/Audacia.CodeAnalysis?path=%2FAudacia.CodeAnalysis.Typescript%2F.eslintrc.js)

Finally, ensure that your editor is set to use ESLint. Jetbrains Rider comes with ESLint support preinstalled and there is a plugin for VS Code.
