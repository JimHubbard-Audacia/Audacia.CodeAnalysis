# Overview

The `Audacia.CodeAnalysis` repo contains static code analysis rulesets and analyzers.

The 'Rulesets' folder contains code that generates NuGet and npm packages that can be used in codebases to enforce coding standards.

The 'Analyzers' folder contains custom analyzers (that can be used in the above rulesets).
